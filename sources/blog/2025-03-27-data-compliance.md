excerpt: Understand exactly what EmailEngine stores, how it encrypts secrets, and how to wipe data when a customer asks for it.

> **TL;DR**
> EmailEngine only keeps the minimum metadata it needs to sync mail - nothing leaves **your** infrastructure, and you can wipe everything with a single Redis command.

## Why it matters

Moving email through your SaaS means you’re touching PII and potentially regulated content (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.). Storing less data - and encrypting what you must keep - shrinks your compliance surface and calms security auditors.

> 🛠️ **Self‑hosted reassurance** – EmailEngine processes email entirely inside **your** infrastructure; no data leaves your network.

## What EmailEngine stores (and when)

EmailEngine tracks state in Redis so it can answer questions like “Has message _123_ changed since the last webhook?” The exact data set depends on the backend.

> 🗒️ **Note** – EmailEngine stores message metadata **only for IMAP accounts**. Gmail API and Microsoft Graph accounts rely on provider‑side change tracking, so EmailEngine keeps **no local index** for them. Likewise, if you enable the _fast_ indexer for IMAP (see [**Supported account types**](https://emailengine.app/supported-account-types)), EmailEngine skips the per‑message index altogether.

### 1. Account data

- **Name** – free‑form label you provide.
- **Username** – often the mailbox address.
- **Secrets** – IMAP/SMTP password or OAuth2 tokens, encrypted at rest.

### 2. Folder‑level data

If a field never changes - or reveals sensitive content (e.g. _Subject_) - EmailEngine fetches it live from the mail server instead of caching it.

## Encryption

### Field‑level (secrets)

EmailEngine encrypts every value marked as _secret_ with **AES‑256‑GCM**. Provide the key via [`EENGINE_SECRET`](__GHOST_URL__/enabling-secret-encryption/).

### Disk‑level

EmailEngine never touches disk directly; Redis does. Use encrypted volumes (LUKS, EBS‑encrypted, etc.) for your Redis data dir if regulatory rules require it.

### In transit

1. **REST API** – bind EmailEngine to `localhost` and terminate TLS at your reverse proxy.
2. **Redis** – use `rediss://` or an SSH tunnel for clusters.
3. **IMAP/SMTP** – EmailEngine always attempts `STARTTLS` or TLS. Most modern providers refuse plaintext logins anyway.

## Deleting data

Removing an account via **`DELETE /v1/accounts/:id`** wipes every related key in Redis. Legacy instances (< 2.0) may leave a pathname list behind - you can purge it manually:

    $ redis-cli DEL iah:<accountId>

### Backups

Because all state is Redis, your backups are Redis RDB/AOF snapshots. Decide - together with your Data Protection Officer - whether a GDPR “right to be forgotten” request affects historical RDB/AOF files.
